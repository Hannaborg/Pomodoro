## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro", the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.
